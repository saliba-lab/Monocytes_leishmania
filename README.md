# Monocytes_leishmania
Repository under progress

Update 16/06/23: Repository will be updated shortly after publication to include the download of the count matrix from GEO.

Update 03/07/23: Link to download the count matrix has been updated. 


This repository contains scripts for the scRNAseq analysis of monocytes infected by Leishmania


## Data Accessibility
For now, the count matrix can be downloaded from the [Helmholtz Cloud](https://syncandshare.desy.de/index.php/s/Rsz7wyHw8mYj8Xj).
The count matrix should be manually download and place in the data folder of the repository.

## Repository Structure
**data:** Directory containing required raw data. The count matrix should be manually placed in this directory too. A metadata table describing relevant experimental information for each single-cell library is also included (Info_experiment.csv)

**analysis:** Directory containing the R scripts.

**outputs:** This directory is created when running the scripts. It will contain the processed data and different results including differentially expressed gene tables, annotated Seurat objects, plots...

## Code Execution
#### 1- Download repository
Option 1: Download manually the repository as a ZIP archive and extract it locally on your computer
